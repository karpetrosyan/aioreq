**Aioreq** is a Python low-level asynchronous HTTP client library. It is built on top of TCP sockets and implements the HTTP protocol entirely on his own.

## Documentation
[Click here][documentation]

## Install
``` shell
$ pip install aioreq
```

## Usage
### Basic usage
---
``` python
>>> import aioreq
>>> import asyncio
>>>
>>> cl = aioreq.Client()
>>>
>>> resp = asyncio.run(
...	cl.get('https://www.google.com')
...	)
>>> resp
<Response 200 OK>
>>> resp.status
200
>>> resp.status_message
'OK'
>>> resp.request
<Request GET https://www.google.com>
>>> headers = resp.headers # dict
>>> body = resp.content # bytes object

```

Alternatively, the best practice is to use a **Context manager**.
``` python
>>> import aioreq
>>> import asyncio
>>>
>>> async def main():
...     async with aioreq.Client() as cl:
...         return await cl.get('https://google.com')
>>> asyncio.run(main())
<Response 200 OK>

```

### More advanced usage
---

This code will asynchronously send 100 get requests to [`google.com`](https://www.google.com), which is much faster than synchronous libraries.

``` python
>>> import asyncio
>>> import aioreq
>>>
>>> async def main():
...     async with aioreq.http.Client() as cl:
...         tasks = []
...         for j in range(100):
...             tasks.append(
...                 asyncio.create_task(
...                     cl.get('https://www.google.com/', )
...                 )
...             )
...         await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
>>> asyncio.run(main())

```

### Streams
---
We occasionally use the HTTP protocol to download videos, photos, and possibly files. When downloading very large files, Stream must be used instead of the default Client. When a client downloads videos or files, the server responds with all information including headers, status code, status message, and full body, which can be very large. As a result, we cannot store it in RAM. Stream only returns a portion of the body per iteration, allowing us to write it to disk, then receive another portion and solve the ram overflow problem.

There is some fundamental Stream usage.
``` python
>>> import aioreq
>>> import asyncio
>>> 
>>> async def main():
...        async with aioreq.StreamClient() as cl:
...                # This code iterates through the message and yields each received chunk separately.
...                async for chunk in cl.get('https://google.com'):
...                        ...
>>> asyncio.run(main())

```

## Benchmarks
**Aioreq** is a very fast library, and we compared it to other Python libraries to demonstrate its speed.

### Benchmark run

First, clone aioreq [repository][mygit].

Then...

``` shell
$ cd aioreq
$ python -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
$ pip install '.[benchmarks]'
$ cd benchmarks
$ python run_tests_functions.py
```

---

### Benchmark results

This is the **average** execution time of each library for **200 asynchronous requests** where responses was received without **chunked** transfer encoding.

As you can see, the synchronous code lags far behind when we make many requests at the same time.<br />
